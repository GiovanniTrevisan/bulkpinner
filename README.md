# Bulk Pinner

Bulk Pinner has been shut down by Pinterest. They haven't given me a reason, in fact they've been ignoring all correspondence.

I have decided to shut down the Bulk Pinner repository, as someone has taken my code and uploaded it to a different domain as their own work, even having the audacity to change the donation link to point to their account, even though I am, and always have been, the sole developer on the project.
